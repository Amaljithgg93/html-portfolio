 <h3>Maheshinte Prathikaaram (2016)</h3>
<p>This directorial debut of Dileesh Pothan is a “serious comedy” in Fahadh Faasil‘s own words, who plays Mahesh in the film. A group of youngsters knocks him down while he attempts to defuse a conflict between his friend and them. Unable to fight back, an embarrassed Mahesh publicly vows that he will not wear his slippers again until he has avenged his humiliation. Instead of relying on the usual mix of hate and anger for revenge, the writer Syam Pushkaran intelligently uses comedy to draw reactions from the characters and develop a gripping, funny screenplay (which won the National Award).</p>

<h3>Dasharatham (1989)</h3>
<p>Released in the same year as another Sibi Malayil-A.K. Lothidas collaborative masterpiece, “Kireedam,” “Dasharatham” wasn’t a major box office success, although, in the later years, it joined the list of under-appreciated 1980s Malayalam movies. Unlike many working-class protagonists Mohanlal played in the 1980s, Rajiv Menon in “Dhasaratham” is a spoiled rich man who, having never experienced the unconditional love of a parent, drowns his sorrow in alcohol and other debaucheries. But something within Rajiv changes when he gets a taste of unconditional love when his friend’s children stay with him for a week. Rajiv desires a kid but wants to subvert the social constraints of a relationship. Hence, Rajiv chooses traditional surrogacy and goes through a dramatic journey of self-discovery as he finds a surrogate mother. </p>
<h3>Aattam (2024)</h3>
<p>Anand Ekarshi’s riveting feature-film directorial debut, “Aattam” (“The Play”), is a brilliant study of the male psyche and male entitlement. A group of men from a theatre troupe come together to speak about a sexual harassment incident that has befallen their sole female colleague. While trying to reach a consensus on what to do about the suspected man (from their troupe), the dynamics between the characters gradually lead to a commotion that unmasks the pervasiveness of patriarchy and its different shades. Aattam’s chamber drama setup might draw comparisons with Lumet’s “12 Angry Men.” But these are totally different films.</p>
